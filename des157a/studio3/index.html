    <h1>Battle of the Alphas</h1>
    <h2>FP Edition</h2>
    <p>
        Rancho and Bella are best friends that rule Forest Park Dog Park but they fight to lead the pack. Play to find out who runs the fastest to lead the pack in their daily zoomies runs!
    </p> 
    <p>
        Choose to play as Rancho or Bella. Click ‘Fuel’ to find out how many treats your doggo gets to help them run faster. They hate seeing few treats. Throwing one treat will lead to them slowing to a stop. One more treat and your doggo has to start all over. Reach the front of the pack(30 yards) to be crowned alpha!
