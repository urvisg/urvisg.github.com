                It is easy to bypass something as simple as forms when thinking about designing a website. However, as most web pages require accounts, the need for forms that are simple and easy to fill out have become necessary to ensure a user proceeds to the main product. This article on “Best Practices for Form Design” points out parts of form design that I had not thought of.

                One aspect of the article that was especially intriguing was the section on placeholder text. I remember seeing it being used to replace the inclusion of example text in the label (e.g. Zip Code (e.g. 95616)). While it seems like a great UI idea that takes up less space, in terms of UX, I can see how inconvenient the disappearing text can be. I have even struggled with placeholder text a couple of times. In the past, I have read articles about the growing popularity of floating labels for text fields. I wonder if that could be adapted to be used for placeholder text instead of labels as a way to practice best UX practices while working for a nice UI.

                The section of default values makes a great point on user “laziness” when it comes to automatic input verification. I do not usually check the sections of forms that are auto-input, usually because they are also disabled. I think a page in the form that confirms auto-input text would help to avoid this problem. Additionally, this section made me think of deceptive design. Many companies use default values in the checkboxes for subscription services such as for products or newsletters. Default opt-in is easy to miss and often users are left with subscriptions they do not want and have to manually unsubscribe from, which can lead to negative experiences with the brand/company.

                A website that I think exhibits many of the best practices is <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a>. The form for creating a new account does not use placeholder text and informs users of the password requirements before they start and while they are typing. Additionally, it provides specific error messages that help to complete the form faster.
