            <h4>My Image</h4>
            <p>This image is interesting due to the small details that tell a story. I am clearly dressed in a simple outfit and my posture communicates that I was not feeling very awake and confident. The angle the image is taken in faces downwards as though I am slouching. You can see my roommate and my closets which are not neat but not entirely messy either. The lighting is harsh which makes me think I took this picture at night after forgetting to do so in the morning.
            </p>
            <p>This image fits perfectly into my collection: my fashion looks during my freshman year at UC Davis. I would wear this outfit on days when I had barely slept or had woken up late. It does differ from the other images as I am not dressed up as nicely. I think it juxtaposes the rest well by showing the not so glamorous side of the first year at university.
            </p>
            <p>The collection of photos focuses on an essential part of who I am: my fashion. I am a person who likes to dress nicely. Which means every part of what I wear is thought out, from the earrings to the shoes. I have never once worn sweatpants or pajamas outside of my house since middle school. I believe in dressing up to do your best as it sets a foundation for starting the day whereas pajamas make me feel lazy. I think the images show how I felt each day as a freshman and how I imagined the rest of the day would go. Fancier outfits were for days where I needed a confidence boost and simpler but well-thought outfits for more casual days.</p>
            <h4>Alvin's Image</h4>
            <p>This image is about Angela, Alvin’s girlfriend. He mentioned that these images document his first date with her outside of school. There are two images that only feature Angela, while the third shows both of them.</p>
            <p>One thing to note about the images is that they are polaroids. This changes how each image is framed as well as the coloring of each one. They carry a feel of nostalgia and happiness as people use polaroids only when documenting important times these days. The velvet background makes the polaroids pop and bring more attention to them. The images of Angela are close up and capture her in a closeup fashion that makes it feel like you are looking at her.</p>
            <p>The most mysterious aspect of this image is the background of the photos. There is greenery and nature that hints to a park or some other nature filled location. However, I think the simplicity of the background really emphasizes the foreground. The focus is on Angela and them as a couple in this particular memory. The background could be any unknown mysterious location but the people in the images will still stand out.</p>

            <p>During my exploration of websites that utilize images and interaction, I came across a website by <a href="http://kevin-beck.co.uk/">Kevin Beck</a>. The website is sparse and contains only a couple images that move and follow your cursor as you move around the page. When you click on an image, you are presented with a way to interact with it whether you hover over it to zoom in, scroll to bring in new photos, or move around to pixelate it with different images. Each image from the landing page directs you to a different interaction style.
            </p>
            <p>I think the website has an element of wonder and surprise as you navigate through it. I did not know what to expect at first, but the developer has provided instructions that follow your cursor to guide you through the experience. My favorite interaction included a hover style that changed small squares of the images to other images. I was never able to see the original image as a whole but it made me imagine what it would look like and fill in the gaps myself. These interactions also brought the images to life. Instead of having them as videos, the interactions provided the moving parts that gave each image a story.
            </p>
            <p>The letters on the page are also an interactive element. They play with the images as your cursor moves but come together to form the words “Photographed by Kevin” when you scroll to the bottom of the page. This organized chaos pulls users to be more active in the viewing and interaction process, therefore making the content of more interest.</p>

                I chose to read the article titled <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">“Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes”</a>. This article analyzed the appropriate and misuses of overlays on webpages. When starting to read, I did not know what overlay and lightbox meant in terms of design. They are often used to confirm actions, present content, and push subscriptions. However, after reading, I understand their meanings and have some thoughts on their uses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The article makes great points related to the size and formatting of overlays in desktop vs mobile environments. I have had occasions when I have opened up the mobile versions of webpages, only to close it due to an overlay stopping me from entering the page. Usually the buttons to move through the page get cut off without the ability to scroll to find them. This problem can be fixed by enabling scroll, however, the problem is better off avoided entirely. I think the best option would be to modify the overlay design for small screen sizes. It is more work but it will make it easier for users to use the pages without dealing with any negative experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                One detail that stood out to me is that overlays cannot be treated as their own pages and therefore do not have their own links. This changes how I think about overlay design. The article mentions the need for extra save and share buttons for the specialized content. I feel like overlays shouldn’t contain content that would be shared a lot. They should supplement the current page rather than introducing new information. Giving overlays that contain important, standalone content its own designated page would better allow for links to be accessed without dealing with any new, repetitive actions that might get confusing.
            </p>
            <p>
                This article was very educational and made me look at overlays in a different and more particular way. Going forward, I will try to evaluate whether overlays are necessary or not depending on their context and make note of how users can interact with them in different screen sizes.

                It is easy to bypass something as simple as forms when thinking about designing a website. However, as most web pages require accounts, the need for forms that are simple and easy to fill out have become necessary to ensure a user proceeds to the main product. This article on “Best Practices for Form Design” points out parts of form design that I had not thought of.
            </p>
            <p>
                One aspect of the article that was especially intriguing was the section on placeholder text. I remember seeing it being used to replace the inclusion of example text in the label (e.g. Zip Code (e.g. 95616)). While it seems like a great UI idea that takes up less space, in terms of UX, I can see how inconvenient the disappearing text can be. I have even struggled with placeholder text a couple of times. In the past, I have read articles about the growing popularity of floating labels for text fields. I wonder if that could be adapted to be used for placeholder text instead of labels as a way to practice best UX practices while working for a nice UI.
            </p>
            <p>
                The section of default values makes a great point on user “laziness” when it comes to automatic input verification. I do not usually check the sections of forms that are auto-input, usually because they are also disabled. I think a page in the form that confirms auto-input text would help to avoid this problem. Additionally, this section made me think of deceptive design. Many companies use default values in the checkboxes for subscription services such as for products or newsletters. Default opt-in is easy to miss and often users are left with subscriptions they do not want and have to manually unsubscribe from, which can lead to negative experiences with the brand/company.
            </p>
            <p>
                A website that I think exhibits many of the best practices is <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a>. The form for creating a new account does not use placeholder text and informs users of the password requirements before they start and while they are typing. Additionally, it provides specific error messages that help to complete the form faster.
