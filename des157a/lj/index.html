                I chose to read the article titled <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">“Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes”</a>. This article analyzed the appropriate and misuses of overlays on webpages. When starting to read, I did not know what overlay and lightbox meant in terms of design. They are often used to confirm actions, present content, and push subscriptions. However, after reading, I understand their meanings and have some thoughts on their uses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The article makes great points related to the size and formatting of overlays in desktop vs mobile environments. I have had occasions when I have opened up the mobile versions of webpages, only to close it due to an overlay stopping me from entering the page. Usually the buttons to move through the page get cut off without the ability to scroll to find them. This problem can be fixed by enabling scroll, however, the problem is better off avoided entirely. I think the best option would be to modify the overlay design for small screen sizes. It is more work but it will make it easier for users to use the pages without dealing with any negative experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                One detail that stood out to me is that overlays cannot be treated as their own pages and therefore do not have their own links. This changes how I think about overlay design. The article mentions the need for extra save and share buttons for the specialized content. I feel like overlays shouldn’t contain content that would be shared a lot. They should supplement the current page rather than introducing new information. Giving overlays that contain important, standalone content its own designated page would better allow for links to be accessed without dealing with any new, repetitive actions that might get confusing.
            </p>
            <p>
                This article was very educational and made me look at overlays in a different and more particular way. Going forward, I will try to evaluate whether overlays are necessary or not depending on their context and make note of how users can interact with them in different screen sizes.

            <h1>Best Practices for Form Design</h1>

                It is easy to bypass something as simple as forms when thinking about designing a website. However, as most web pages require accounts, the need for forms that are simple and easy to fill out have become necessary to ensure a user proceeds to the main product. This article on “Best Practices for Form Design” points out parts of form design that I had not thought of.
            </p>

                One aspect of the article that was especially intriguing was the section on placeholder text. I remember seeing it being used to replace the inclusion of example text in the label (e.g. Zip Code (e.g. 95616)). While it seems like a great UI idea that takes up less space, in terms of UX, I can see how inconvenient the disappearing text can be. I have even struggled with placeholder text a couple of times. In the past, I have read articles about the growing popularity of floating labels for text fields. I wonder if that could be adapted to be used for placeholder text instead of labels as a way to practice best UX practices while working for a nice UI.
            </p>
            <p>
                The section of default values makes a great point on user “laziness” when it comes to automatic input verification. I do not usually check the sections of forms that are auto-input, usually because they are also disabled. I think a page in the form that confirms auto-input text would help to avoid this problem. Additionally, this section made me think of deceptive design. Many companies use default values in the checkboxes for subscription services such as for products or newsletters. Default opt-in is easy to miss and often users are left with subscriptions they do not want and have to manually unsubscribe from, which can lead to negative experiences with the brand/company.
            </p>

                A website that I think exhibits many of the best practices is <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a>. The form for creating a new account does not use placeholder text and informs users of the password requirements before they start and while they are typing. Additionally, it provides specific error messages that help to complete the form faster.
