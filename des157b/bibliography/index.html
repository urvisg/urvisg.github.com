            <h2>Director, Julia Cusick Senior, et al. <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/quick-facts-gender-wage-gap/">“Quick Facts About the Gender Wage Gap.”</a> Center for American Progress, 19 Jan. 2022, www.americanprogress.org/article/quick-facts-gender-wage-gap/.</h2>
            <p>This article was written to provide a guide to understanding the nuances of the gender wage gap that are not usually mentioned with the topic. The author emphasizes that there are a multitude of factors that contribute to the existing gap not directly due to gender. Much of the issue is related to the societal expectations and constraints on women that result in a lower salary to the male counterpart. The gap may seem small per year, but accumulated over a lifetime, the loss is hundreds of thousands of dollars. This article provides the underlying causes of the wage gap as well as how the solution is far more complicated than simply making pay equal. My project will have to cater to these issues to target the wider idea of the wage gap.</p>

            <p>The purpose of this article is to address how and why the gender wage gap persists today. The issue can be attributed to the existence of both a ‘glass ceiling’ and ‘sticky floor’ that keep women from being able to obtain equality in the workplace. Coronavirus has had a significant impact on the wage gap, not because it decreased the wage gap, but due to the fact that many women lost or had to give up their jobs. My project is aimed towards the current status of this issue at the current time. This article discusses how the recent pandemic has affected the gap, as well as how the gap can be narrowed.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13XU4fMlN3w">“What People Miss About the Gender Wage Gap.”</a> Youtube, uploaded by Vox, 17 Sept. 2016, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13XU4fMlN3w.</h2>
            <p>This video dives deeper into why the gender gap came to be and how it is prevalent today. The emphasis lies in the industry that women work in as the hours and responsibilities associated with jobs in different industries. Women in business related jobs seem to have the widest gap and that is due to meetings being very strict on time, in comparison to jobs in science and technology which offer more flexible hours. The way in which employee success is measured within each job affects salaries directly, and therefore women as well. The video provided more insight as to how industries of work have their own issues of unequal pay. This knowledge will be useful in defining how content is categorized and what inputs need to be included in the form submissions.</p>
