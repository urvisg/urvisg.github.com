    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This user testing was conducted in a classroom environment in which my peers were the participants. The participants had only been exposed to my interactive design comp prior to the testing session. Three rounds took place in which users had 2 minutes to explore the project and 6 minutes to answer questions/discuss any feedback.
    </p>

    <h2>Round 1</h2>
    <p>
        This user was the first to test the project. The color scheme received positive feedback and the interactions with the pages are easy to navigate. Through watching them interact, I noticed some simple issues in state changes between pages such as the ‘Resources’ link staying bolded even when moving to a different page. An important paint point was some areas of ambiguity. The toggle button has only one label that shows up at a time and the user was confused as to what would happen if they clicked on it, causing some hesitation. Additionally, the ‘Submit’ button does not communicate to the user what will happen when they click on it. ‘Submit’ is usually a finishing action button and this stops the participant from clicking on it. The wording can be changed to avoid this.
    </p>

    <h2>Round 2</h2>
    <p>
        Many of the successes of the previous round were reaffirmed in this session. However, more issues were brought up with the map interactions. This user tried to close the sidebar on the map but was unable to, citing that they wanted to close it “to see the map in a wider view”. The markers on the map were difficult to identify due to low contrast and red was suggested as a color that might be easier to see quickly. Additionally, the longer submissions on the list page felt like too much scrolling and would have been easier if the text was wider horizontally. Due to technical issues, this user was unable to see the permissions required to use the form(to pull their geolocation). When told about this capability, they mentioned the case in which a user might not be using the website from the same place at which their story takes place, creating a disconnect. We discussed having the users manually inputting their desired coordinates instead.
    </p>

    <h2>Round 3</h2>
    <p>
        This user liked the color choice and its neutrality in relation to the subject. The landing page was really helpful and expressed wanting to be able to go back to it without having to refresh the website. The explore map caused confusion seen in their clicks all over the map where there were no data points. They discussed their confusion about how the interaction with the map works, initially thinking that clicking on the map would open the ability to submit a response. The wording for the labels were unclear and the user hesitated between each step in the form. As a result their final submission used anonymous in the username and the location section only had a state without a city. This established the issue of clarity as to what the user is expected to put into the form.
    </p>

    <h2>Updating the Project</h2>
    <p>
        There is considerable work left on the backend to make the website features work but there are many takeaways that the testing provided that I will be using to iterate the project. There are two main areas to work on. One of which is the form. Starting at the ‘Submit’ button, which is confusing, I will work on the phrasing of the buttons and labels for the inputs to make it very clear what each input expects to take. I will also be adding inputs for latitude and longitude so that the location is customizable rather than restricting the user to the location they are accessing the website from. The other area of improvement is the explore pages. The side overlay on the map has no exit strategy and so I will be adding an ‘x’ to allow users to close that pop up. The data points on the map are not very clear due to low contrast and that will be remedied by experimenting with different colored markers. The list view of the responses works with different lengths of text and this breaks up the reader’s approach to viewing the information. I plan on making every response a specific size and then use a scroll bar to allow them to view more of the responses.
