    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
    <p>
        This project will address gender discrimination in the workplace through a desktop platform that allows uses to share stories of discrimination, or positive experiences, they have faced and the circumstances around it to create an interactive map interface.
    </p>

    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
    <p>
        The goal of this project is to create a positive experience and online environment that allows people to anonymously share their experiences, positive or negative, in order to both help themselves and help others. Ideally, this creates a community that feels safe and is a place to turn to for help. This could also be used to identify areas where gender discrimination in the workplace is less common to visualize patterns and habits. The personal goals I would like to achieve is to successfully display a variety of data on a map. Maps are large and can be used to mark much information. I want to become comfortable with working with a lot of input data.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Strategies</h3>
    <p>
        This project will include a mix of minimalist and bold styles. Large, bold text will be used to communicate a sense of strength and empowerment. Minimalist illustrations and styling will support the text to balance between strong yet inviting. A lot of whitespace will be used within the introductory pages but the page showing the map will likely be filled due to all the information of the page. The focus will be on grouping responses so that users are able to find content easily.
    </p>

    <h3>Interaction Strategies</h3>
    <p>
        A landing page articulating the goals of the platform will rely on a ‘Call to Action’ to move the user to the page with an option to view responses or submit a response. The ‘view’ option can be toggled between a list and map view. The map will require the user to scroll and click points on the map to bring up responses. The ‘list’ option will output responses in a grid format. The ‘Submit A Response’ will use a form with basic fields and questions, without the user’s name, that upon submission will be added to the response list. There will be no way to edit responses as this is anonymous.
