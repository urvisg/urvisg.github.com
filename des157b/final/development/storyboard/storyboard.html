            <h3>Round 1</h3>
            <p>
                My ideas were communicated well and sparked curiosity about a sense of community that would be created through this concept. Of the two ideas, my partner seemed to focus on the wage gap and how it would be helpful especially with the existence of websites such as Glassdoor. I did not change much in the story board but I did redraw it to show more of a story as to how the user would end up using this website.

            <h3>Round 2</h3>
            <p>
                This participant leaned toward the workplace discrimination idea. During testing, a holewas found in my sequence. A user would be likely to confide in another person before turning to an online forum. This opened up questions if this would be a casual forum or a more serious platform for people to share stories. I think I would change what is capable on the web page by adding an area for resources that can help people who are submitting these stories.
